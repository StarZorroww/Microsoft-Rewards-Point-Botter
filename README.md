# Microsoft-Rewards-Point-Botter
This python script will create shit tons of microsoft edge tabs with stupid search terms so you get points for searching things up.
I do not recommend using this unless you want your computer to crash

If you do for some reason, use this, then run it over night, as it takes control of your keyboard and your active window selection.


## Imports
### pynput
* npm install pynput
* Adds keyboard simulation functionality
* (Used to type the search terms)

### subprocess
* npm install subprocess
* Adds program execution functionality
* (Used to open instances of microsoft edge)
